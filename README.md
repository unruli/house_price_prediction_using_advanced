using advanced regression algorithms
the purpose of using multiple regression model was to show how each model was affected by the data set 
and to show 


four diffrent regression models were applied 
#Library for Modelling


from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor  


from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression


from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso


from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge


random forest was used

linear regression was used

lasso regression was used and

ridge regression  was used

another impoertant part was the data cleaning which was the most crucial part. columns with more than 80% missing values were removed and those that stayed were either filled with none in the missing spaces and filed with the median for strings missing.


i was also able to remove outliers which i am very proud of.
